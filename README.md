# python_projects
Projects I am using to learn the ins and outs of the Python Programming Language
I first started with writing a very simple ATM machine project that takes input and returns how much you either withdrew or deposited.
Since then I have added a few more projects that I have been toying with over time.
These should not be viewed as final products as I have used these projects to familiarize myself with the Python language more than anything. That being said, I hope you can have fun with these simple programs.
I am open to all criticism as I want to improve more than anything else. Thank you very much for looking at the projects I have created!
